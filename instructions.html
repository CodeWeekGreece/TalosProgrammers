		<h1>Shop Manager</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Hello dear user, this is an app, that helps you make appointments so as to avoid crowding and wainting in queues in midst of the dangerous pandemic. There are two modes, the book in and the book now. If you press book in, you can choose the food service or regular store in your vicinity and make an appointment to shop or eat there with the press of two buttons. You search, choose the service, and then just pick the hour you want and you are all set. If you choose the book now, you can find random vacant restaurants nearby to get service immideately </h1>
